# Portfolio

---

This repository is home to five of my senior-year computational physics projects: 

* [fourier_sawtooth.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/fourier_sawtooth.ipynb), a simple Fourier series demonstration.

* [hovercraft.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/hovercraft.ipynb), a differential equation-based model of a hovercraft's motion.

* [sine_map_chaos.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/sine_map_chaos.ipynb), an exploration into the chaotic behavior of the sine map.

* [fdm_wave_equation.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/fdm_wave_equation.ipynb), an application of the finite-difference method for solving wave equations.

and my personal favorite, the semester project:

* [notebook_1_injection_orbit.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/notebook_1_injection_orbit.ipynb) and [notebook_2_cycler_petals.ipynb](https://github.com/josephgodoy/portfolio/blob/master/notebook_2_cycler_petals.ipynb), in which I model trans-lunar injection orbits and free-return cycler orbits from noninertial reference frames.

Please enjoy!
